## Objectives

- Keep architecture enforcement lightweight and maintainable.
- Use explicit acceptance criteria and review checks instead of ad-hoc structural scripts.
- Ensure every structural change proves runtime integrity via diagnostics and build.
- Validate progress against the canonical target-state architecture skill using advisory checks.

## Enforcement Model

- Policy source: `architecture/governance/target-state/editor-architecture/SKILL.md`, guardrails skill, and repository documentation.
- Conflict precedence: target-state skill first, then domain guardrails, then repository-level supporting docs.
- Enforcement mechanism: PR review checklist + required build/typecheck status.
- Verification: no runtime code under forbidden patterns (for this repo: no `src/agents`).
- Dependency validation: package-audit evidence for new infrastructure concerns and explicit rationale for custom implementations.
- Practical checklist source: `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- Common remediation patterns: `.github/architecture/violations-and-how-to-fix.md`.

## Advisory Validation Stance

- Validation guidance is advisory and intended to guide architectural convergence.
- Prefer documenting tradeoffs and follow-up migration steps over blocking work when full alignment is not yet practical.

## Acceptance Checks

- Runtime code organization matches agreed product modules.
- Feature boundaries remove unnecessary prop drilling for feature state/actions.
- No dead paths remain from superseded architecture.
- `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` succeed.
- React component and hook changes align with `architecture/governance/implementation/react-patterns/SKILL.md`.
- Advanced property coverage is dependency-driven from metadata sources.
- UI controls are mapped via shared rules, not ad-hoc per-property branching.
- New generic infrastructure work documents package options considered before custom code.
- Custom infrastructure includes explicit justification, risk notes, and maintenance ownership.
