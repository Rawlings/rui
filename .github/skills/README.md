# Skills Taxonomy

This directory is organized by high-level architecture domains with deeper nesting for scope clarity.

## Top-level domains

- architecture: coordination, governance, orchestration, integration, and state history
- experience: authoring tools and interface editing workflows
- styling: CSS system, motion, responsive behavior, and API expansion
- quality: accessibility, testing, and performance
- data: serialization and exchange workflows

## Standards

- Skill frontmatter only uses supported attributes.
- Canonical entries are `name`, `description`, `user-invocable`, and `metadata`.
- Legacy path aliases are documented in aliases.json.

## Product Architecture Guardrails

- Canonical architecture target-state guidance lives in `architecture/governance/target-state/editor-architecture/SKILL.md`.
- Governance and validation skills should reference that target-state skill rather than duplicating policy text.

- Runtime product code must use product-oriented structure such as `src/features`, `src/components`, `src/core`, and `src/hooks`.
- Do not place runtime UI or domain logic under `src/agents`.
- Agent terminology is workflow-only and belongs in documentation or Copilot skill/agent configuration, not product runtime folders.
- Every refactor must remove dead paths and stale imports in the same change.
- Moves must be completed end-to-end: relocate files, update imports, delete obsolete folders, and validate with build and diagnostics.
- For non-differentiating infrastructure, audit mature NPM packages before implementing custom solutions.
- If custom infrastructure is selected, document package options considered and why custom code is the better fit.

## MDN-Driven Guardrails

- Use mdn-data as canonical CSS property metadata.
- Hardcode only curated common-first UX groups; derive advanced catalogs from metadata.
- Map property controls from metadata semantics and syntax, not ad-hoc name lists.
- Keep control mapping and validation test-covered as the catalog scales.
