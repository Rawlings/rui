# WYSIWYG Editor Agents

This file defines specialized agents for developing the WYSIWYG editor. Each agent focuses on a specific aspect of the editor to ensure modular and scalable development.

## Authority

- This file is the authoritative source for agent usage, workflow discipline, and repository-specific implementation baselines.
- Runtime architecture policy authority is delegated to `.github/skills/architecture/governance/target-state/editor-architecture/SKILL.md`.
- For domain implementation rules, follow the relevant SKILL file guidance before AGENTS-level defaults.
- `.github/AGENTS.md` is a redirect only and should not define independent policy.

## Usage

## Invocation Discipline

- Agent names define workflow specialization. Skills define implementation rules.
- For any medium/large refactor or cross-feature change, invoke the architecture target-state skill before coding.
- For domain work, invoke both the domain agent and the matching skill guidance from `.github/skills/README.md`.
- For React or TypeScript implementation work, invoke `.github/skills/architecture/governance/implementation/react-patterns/SKILL.md` before editing.
- When guidance conflicts, follow this precedence order:
  1) `.github/skills/architecture/governance/target-state/editor-architecture/SKILL.md`
  2) domain-specific skill guidance
  3) this AGENTS file (workflow and repository baselines)

## Always-On Architecture Checklist

Run this checklist for every implementation request:

- Identify domain and boundary impact first (canvas, properties, state, toolbar, layers, integration).
- Confirm canonical guidance in `.github/skills/architecture/governance/target-state/editor-architecture/SKILL.md` and relevant domain skills before editing files.
- Confirm React implementation guidance in `.github/skills/architecture/governance/implementation/react-patterns/SKILL.md` for component/hook work.
- Avoid deep cross-feature imports; use public feature APIs and integration boundaries.
- Keep state access at feature boundaries; do not introduce new multi-level state prop threading.
- Remove dead paths and stale imports in the same change when refactoring.
- Validate with `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` when the change is architecture-sensitive or structural.
- If a temporary exception is needed, document it in `.github/architecture/feature-public-api-map.md` with owner and expiry.

## Architecture Target State Skill

- Canonical architecture policy is defined in `.github/skills/architecture/governance/target-state/editor-architecture/SKILL.md`.
- Use this skill when planning medium/large refactors, evaluating architecture drift, or sequencing migrations across canvas/layers/properties/state.
- Pair it with `.github/skills/architecture/governance/scalability/guardrails/SKILL.md` for tactical implementation checks and `.github/skills/architecture/governance/enforcement/architecture-validation/SKILL.md` for review criteria.

Example invocation:

"Using the editor-architecture skill, assess our current module boundaries and propose an incremental migration sequence for state and canvas interactions."

## Property Metadata Baseline

- The properties panel displays all supported MDN properties (no Common/All mode toggle).
- Grouping should come from MDN `groups` first, with heuristic fallback only when metadata is missing.
- Control selection should be syntax-driven:
  - finite keyword-only grammars -> selectable controls
  - mixed/typed grammars (e.g. `box-shadow`) -> flexible text/autocomplete editing
- Suggestions should include both:
  - keyword tokens from expanded syntax references
  - function tokens from grammar/function metadata
- Type hints should be sourced from MDN `types.json` and surfaced in property rows.
- Unit options should be validated against MDN `units.json`.
- `definitions.json` should be used where available for canonical metadata normalization (e.g. group list validation).

## Theming Baseline

- Use only the imported default PrimeReact theme for PrimeReact components.
- Do not add or maintain a parallel token-based theming layer for PrimeReact UI surfaces.
- Prefer PrimeReact component defaults and props over custom styling wrappers.
- Use custom CSS only for layout/positioning or non-Prime canvas interaction affordances.
- **Color sourcing**: All semantic colors in editor UI must come from PrimeReact CSS variables — not from Tailwind color utilities.
  - Text: `var(--text-color)`, `var(--text-color-secondary)`
  - Accent: `var(--primary-color)`, `var(--primary-color-text)`
  - Surfaces: `var(--surface-ground)`, `var(--surface-card)`, `var(--surface-section)`, `var(--surface-overlay)`
  - Borders/dividers: `var(--surface-border)`
  - Hover: `var(--surface-hover)`
  - Selection: `var(--highlight-bg)`, `var(--highlight-text-color)`
  - Numeric steps: `var(--surface-0)` … `var(--surface-900)`
  - Named palette: `var(--blue-500)`, `var(--gray-200)`, etc.
- Tailwind utilities remain acceptable for layout, spacing, sizing, and flex/grid.
- For color, use Tailwind arbitrary value utilities that reference PrimeReact CSS variables (e.g. `text-[var(--text-color)]`, `bg-[var(--surface-card)]`, `border-[var(--surface-border)]`).
- Do not introduce custom semantic helper classes in `app/app.css` or `src/app.css` for color tokens when the same can be expressed inline with Tailwind variable utilities.
- For focus treatment, use outline-based styling (e.g. `outline-*`, `outline-offset-*`) rather than border/shadow rings for focus indicators.
- For docked side rails (Layers/Properties), prefer plain semantic containers over `Panel` when Panel features (toggle/collapse/chrome) are not required.
- Side rails should dock flush to viewport edges (no outer gap), and default chrome should avoid rounded corners.
- Use shadows (not borders) for floating chrome separation consistently across side rails and toolbar, unless a specific control needs a divider.
- For selected states in lists/trees, use high-contrast token pairs (e.g. `bg-[var(--primary-color)]` + `text-[var(--primary-color-text)]` or `bg-[var(--highlight-bg)]` + `text-[var(--highlight-text-color)]`).

To invoke an agent, mention it in your query, e.g., "Using the Canvas Agent, implement drag functionality."

For complex features requiring multiple agents, use the Orchestration Agent to coordinate the workflow.

These agents help maintain a scalable structure for the growing WYSIWYG editor project.
