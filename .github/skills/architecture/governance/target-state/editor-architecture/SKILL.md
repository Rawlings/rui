## Objectives

- Establish a single architecture source of truth for editor runtime structure.
- Reduce coupling across canvas, layers, properties, toolbar, and shared state.
- Keep refactors incremental and advisory while preserving product velocity.
- Make architectural decisions reviewable through explicit boundaries and contracts.

## Current-State Risks This Skill Addresses

- Split runtime entry patterns and shell ownership across app paths.
- Broad, shared command surfaces that increase cross-feature coupling.
- Distributed viewport and interaction math across multiple components and hooks.
- Property metadata and control mapping logic concentrated in fragile utility chains.
- Duplicate style entry points and inconsistent ownership of styling conventions.

## Wanted-State Architecture Blueprint

### 1) Runtime Shell and Entry

- Maintain one runtime application entry path and one shell ownership model.
- Keep theme/provider bootstrap centralized.
- Route-level pages should compose feature modules, not embed feature internals.

### 2) Product Module Layout

- Runtime code belongs under product-oriented paths such as `src/features`, `src/core`, `src/hooks`, and `src/components`.
- Keep feature internals private by default; export stable public APIs at feature boundaries.
- Avoid role-oriented runtime folders and workflow-oriented runtime placement.

### 3) State and Command Boundaries

- Separate query surfaces from mutation surfaces.
- Prefer narrow feature command APIs over broad global command bags.
- Expose state/actions through feature boundaries, not deep prop threading.
- Keep command semantics explicit (selection, layering, transform, metadata, creation).

### 4) Interaction and Viewport Model

- Centralize screen/world transform logic in a single reusable module.
- Define one interaction state model for pointer workflows (idle, drag, resize, text edit).
- Keep event ownership unambiguous: one gesture maps to one handler chain.
- Treat snapping and guide rendering as interaction-domain concerns, not ad hoc UI side effects.

### 5) Properties and Metadata Pipeline

- Keep mdn-data as canonical source for property metadata and syntax semantics.
- Separate registry concerns from control inference concerns and hint-generation concerns.
- Favor syntax-driven control mapping over property-name branching.
- Keep extensibility points explicit for additional metadata and control families.

### 6) UI and Styling System

- Use PrimeReact components and PrimeReact CSS variables for semantic color usage.
- Keep Tailwind utilities focused on layout, spacing, sizing, and positioning.
- Avoid duplicate style entry points and ad hoc local styling rules when shared conventions exist.
- Keep reusable UI primitives discoverable and consistent across toolbar, panels, and tree controls.

## Dependency Rules (Advisory)

- Features may depend on `src/core` and shared UI primitives.
- Features should not import deep internals from sibling features.
- Cross-feature workflows should integrate through public feature APIs or integration modules.
- Non-differentiating infrastructure should follow dependency-first selection before custom implementation.

## Migration Heuristics

- Prioritize changes that reduce coupling without changing behavior.
- Use strangler-style migrations: introduce boundary API, migrate callsites, remove old paths.
- Complete structural moves end-to-end in one change set when feasible.
- Track and remove dead files/folders as part of each migration.
- If a full migration is not feasible, document interim boundaries and follow-up steps.

## Suggested Review Prompts

- Does this change move architecture toward a single runtime shell and clear ownership?
- Does it reduce prop drilling or context overreach?
- Does it centralize transforms/interaction logic instead of spreading them further?
- Does it preserve metadata-driven property control mapping?
- Does it remove obsolete paths introduced by refactor work?

## Acceptance Checklist (Advisory)

- Runtime code organization aligns with product modules.
- Feature boundaries are clearer than before this change.
- No new deep cross-feature internal imports are introduced.
- Build and typecheck expectations are documented and run when relevant.
- Any custom infrastructure decision records package options considered.

## When To Invoke This Skill

- Planning medium/large refactors across editor features.
- Reviewing architecture drift after rapid feature expansion.
- Defining migration sequence from current state to target state.
- Evaluating whether a proposed change improves or degrades architectural boundaries.
